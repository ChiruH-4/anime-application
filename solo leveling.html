        <h5 class="card-title">Sung Jin-Woo</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Sung Jin-woo begins Solo Leveling as the world's weakest hunter, but through his sheer strength of will, he grows into the strongest being in his universe. While the Absolute was killed by the Rulers' combined effort, it's implied at the end of the series that Jin-woo even strikes fear in the Rulers. He also kills every single one of the Monarchs by himself, making him easily the strongest among them.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">The Absolute Being Created the Entire Universe</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The Absolute Being's name says everything about him anyone would need to know. The Absolute was the creator of the universe in Solo Leveling, thus making him the highest god of Sung Jin-woo's world. The Absolute Being created all the Monarchs and Rulers, but his creations betrayed him and killed him to take his throne. The extent of his combat abilities isn't known, but given that all the strongest beings in Solo Leveling were created by the Absolute's power, it stands to reason that he’s at the top of the food chain.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Antares</h5>
        <p class="card-text">As the Monarchs begin to fall to the Rulers, Antares is the only one whose sheer power gives him the authority to continue the war. The Monarch of Destruction is easily the strongest of the Monarchs other than Jin-woo, and may potentially be even more powerful than any one Ruler on their own.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Ashborn</h5>
        <p class="card-text">As the original Shadow Monarch, Ashborn is easily one of the most powerful beings in the entire Solo Leveling universe. He was initially the Brightest Fragment of Brilliant Light, making him the strongest of the Rulers, before he stood up to them in defense of the Absolute and became a Monarch.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">The Brightest Fragment of Brilliant Light is the Strongest Ruler</h5>
        <p class="card-text">Chairman of the South Korean Hunter Association, Go Gunhee, is the vessel for the current Brightest Fragment of Brilliant Light.It's hard to scale the Rulers due to how little of their combat abilities are shown. However, the feats that they do pull off can still give a pretty decent indication of where the very strongest of their ranks might at least stack up.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">legia</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The proof of Legia's strength is in the circumstances surrounding his death. When Jin-woo first met him, Legias had been captured and held prisoner by the Rulers in chains. He then tried to make a deal with Jin-woo, but seeing through Legia's lies, Jin-woo attempted to kill the Monarch while he was still chained down.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">The Rulers Always Fight as a Group</h5>
        <p class="card-text">As the protectors of the Absolute, the Rulers were specifically made by the creator of the universe to defend the world with their supreme power. The individual combat abilities of the Rulers are never shown, because they tend to always fight as a group. However, the feats they achieve as a group are some of the greatest in the series.</p>

        <h5 class="card-title">Yogumunt</h5>
        <p class="card-text">While not much is shown of his individual powers in battle, Yogumunt is heavily implied to be one of the most powerful and intelligent of the Monarchs. In the light novel, Yogumunt was stated to have been the most difficult for Jin-woo to kill out of all the Monarchs, other than the Monarch of Destruction.</p>

        <p class="card-text">The Beast Monarch is one of the most formidable foes Jin-woo faces.
          His raw physical strength and ferocity in battle are unparalleled, making him a terror on the battlefield.
          The Beast Monarch's command over beasts and ability to summon powerful creatures add another layer of danger, making him a multidimensional threat. His physical prowess is complemented by his tactical intelligence, forcing Jin-woo to defeat him with all his cunning and strength. His ability to rally and control vast numbers of beasts makes him a force of nature, capable of overwhelming even the most prepared defenses.</p>

          Her powers allow her to manipulate life and death on a massive scale, making her a deadly adversary.
          The Plague Monarch can summon swarms of insects to overwhelm her enemies, adding another layer of danger to her already formidable arsenal. Her ability to inflict and manipulate ailments makes her one of the most dangerous Monarchs, posing a significant threat even to the strongest Hunters and armies. Her mastery over diseases allows her to create a battlefield where she holds the advantage, turning the environment into a deadly trap for her enemies.</p>

      <div class="card-body">
        <h5 class="card-title"> King of Steel</h5>
        <p class="card-text">The Iron Body Monarch is renowned for his near-invincibility.
          His body, made of a metal-like substance, makes him impervious to most physical attacks, providing him with an incredible defense against opponents.
          Despite his lack of speed, the Iron Body Monarch's sheer physical strength and nearly impenetrable defense require strategic thinking and exceptional strength from Jin-woo and his allies. His ability to withstand powerful attacks without sustaining damage makes him a significant threat in prolonged battles, where his endurance becomes decisive.</p>

        <p class="card-text">Bellion, as the first Shadow Soldier created by Ashborn, holds a unique position in the Solo Leveling universe.
          He serves as the Grand Marshal of the Shadow Army and is the strongest of Jin-woo's shadows, surpassing even Beru and Igris.
          Bellion's loyalty and dedication to the Shadow Monarch are unwavering, and his presence on the battlefield often turns the tide in favor of Jin-woo's forces. His combat skills are refined, showcasing mastery that makes him a force to be reckoned with. Bellion can lead the Shadow Army in battles that would be impossible for ordinary Hunters to win, demonstrating his unmatched leadership and tactical understanding.</p>
