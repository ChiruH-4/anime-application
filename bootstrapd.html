                  <h5 class="card-title">Tanjiro Kamado</h5>
                  <p class="card-text"> Tanjiro is kind to his friends, but he also doesn't hesitate to scold them for their poor behavior, particularly when it comes to Inosuke and Zenitsu. Tanjiro is also excessively generous, and with due time, he learns that not everyone — especially demons — deserves his kindness. Yet, Tanjiro's compassion initially extends to everyone around him, including demons. After discovering the truth about Rui, Tanjiro killed the Mother Spider Demon with the most merciful attack in his arsenal. That said, Tanjiro grows stronger and slightly hardens in spirit as Demon Slayer goes on. Over time, he becomes more logical and cunning when it comes to his strategies and battle decisions. Even so, he never lets go of the good that's deep inside him.</p>

                  <h5 class="card-title">Nezuko Kamado</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">An endless onslaught of Nezuko memes floods the internet now, so it should come as no surprise that Nezuko is one of Demon Slayer's most popular characters. Nezuko's infection into a half-demon girl is one of the major catalysts in the series, and the hope of curing her of this ailment remains Tanjiro's North Star during his journey. In fact, there wouldn't even be a story if Muzan hadn't transformed Nezuko in the first place.During early episodes of Demon Slayer, the anime depicts Nezuko as a liability to protect, but she gradually exposes Demon Blood Art powers that put full-blood monsters to shame. At this point in the anime storyline, Nezuko is immune to sunlight, making her extremely valuable to both Muzan and the Hashira. Demon Slayer's relationship with Nezuko continues to evolve, and fans are only more curious about where the supporting player is headed</p>

                  <h5 class="card-title">Muzan-Kibutsuji</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">The strongest of the demons and the one who's ultimately responsible for the proliferation of these deadly monsters, Muzan Kibutsuji represents the paragon of evil in Demon Slayer. Muzan's presence has hung over Tanjiro's actions right from the anime's start. However, Demon Slayer typically just offers glimpses of this monumental villain, at least until the Swordsmith Village arc.

                  <h5 class="card-title">Zenitsu Agatsuma</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">Zenitsu Agatsuma is a popular Demon Slayer character whose most defining trait is that he's a consistent coward who tends to flee from fights, which is ironic given his desire to be a demon slayer. Additionally, Zenitsu struggles with low self-esteem, which is why he goes out of his way to please those around him. Fans initially found him rather objectionable, especially in the anime, given his tendency towards cowardice and wailing.</p>

                  <h5 class="card-title">Inosuke Hashibira</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">One of the more eccentric boys in Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba, Inosuke's unorthodox behavior is attributed to his being raised by boars since he was a child. This demon slayer is loud, aggressive, and prideful. He always brims with overconfidence; as a result, he believes that he'll win any fight he participates in, whether it's against a demon or otherwise. Inosuke is short-tempered, hates losing, and doesn't easily make friends.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Giyu is reserved, always has a serious look on his face, and prefers his own company. He's also extremely strict, which results in constant admonishments to those who "waste" their lives or lose them in "meaningless" activities. Giyu appears uncaring, but he's guided by a strong sense of righteousness. This is clear when he allows Nezuko to live, despite how it strictly goes against the demon slayer code of conduct.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Genya Shinazugawa is the younger brother of fellow demon slayer and Wind Hashira Sanemi, although he's considerably more belligerent and hostile than his sibling. Although Genya is exceptionally powerful, he's still got a long way to go before reaching Hashira level. Genya and Tanjiro ruffle feathers early on during their training in the Swordsmith Village. This is because Genya adopts a lone-wolf mentality, which isn't Tanjiro's style.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Like Muichirou, Kanao knows how to maintain a strong poker face, in part due to her experiences in an abusive household. However, after this ferocious female fighter witnesses demons hurting her loved ones, she develops a strong hatred towards them. Over the passage of time, she also defies her superiors, like she did with Shinobu, and takes part in the Final Selection.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Kyojuro Rengoku is the Flame Hashira of Demon Slayer Corps and one of the best components of Demon Slayer's thrilling "Mugen Train Arc." Kyojuro has a strong moral compass and a respectable idea of right versus wrong. He lives by his code of honor and can't help but defend the weak, like when he steps up to help Tanjiro on the Mugen Train. These honorable qualities were instilled in Kyojuro by his mother, whereas his father wasn't very involved in his upbringing.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The sickly Kagaya Ubuyashiki seemed destined to be a minor background character with no active influence on the storyline. Fans did like how much he cared for the Hashira, not to mention the respect he received from them. However, the Hashira Training arc revealed just how remarkable Ubuyashiki and his family were. When Muzan goes to kill him, Ubuyashiki has a polite conversation with the Demon King while on his literal deathbed.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">The three wives of the Sound Hashira Tengen Uzui — Makio, Suma, and Hinatsuru — play a major role in Demon Slayer's Entertainment District arc. This was also when fans were officially introduced to them, raising several questions regarding the concept of polygamy. Tengen loves and protects his wives and they return the favor, making for one of the more unorthodox relationships in the story. Zenitsu is probably the only one who complained about Tengen having multiple wives, and for very obviously selfish reasons.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Yoriichi Tsugikuni is not even a proper Demon Slayer character because he has already been dead for hundreds of years. And yet, he's become one of the most popular of the bunch. Yoriichi's flashbackstory reveals his origins and how he became the most powerful demon slayer in history, surpassing every Hashira as well as Muzan himself.  Yoriichi brought the Demon King to the brink of death; although Muzan escaped, he would remain terrified of Yoriichi for the rest of his life. Fans love this overpowered character for multiple reasons, including his peerless Sun Breathing technique, but mainly because of his humility. However, Yoriichi's badass nature must also be taken into account: during his final battle with Kokushibo, he was over eighty years old but still managed to defeat and nearly kill the Upper Moon One.</p>

Like many of his comrades among the Hashira, he despises demonkind. Sanemi holds the privilege of being the Demon Slayers' Wind Hashira, and his guidance is instrumental in Tanjiro's progress. Then again, Sanemi's cruel treatment of his younger brother Genya initially bothered the fandom.</p>

She is more than a pacifist; Tamayo has devoted herself to the field of medicine, ready to aid anyone who might need her help in Asakusa, with her assistant Yushiro by her side. She doesn't even kill people to survive, and would rather consume donated blood instead. Most importantly, Tamayo is the one who promised to help cure Nezuko Kamado.</p>
