                  <h5 class="card-title">Mello</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">While the first half of Death Note is a brilliant watch, the same can't be said for the second half, which has a noticeable dip in quality. The leading reason is the main characters of Death Note aren't as interesting in the latter half.</p>

                  <h5 class="card-title">NEAR</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">While Near might also be a rather uninspired Death Note character, with his entire personality being completely ripped from his predecessor, there's no denying the fact that he's still leagues ahead of Mello. There are some places where the audience sees some positive development, as subtle as it is.

                  <h5 class="card-title">Naomi-Misora</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">It's a testament to the brilliant writing in this show that a character who only appeared for one episode ended up being one of the best and most interesting Death Note characters in the entire series.

                  <h5 class="card-title">Takada</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">Takada is a character that appears early in the series but is deliberately kept in the background to hide her nature from everyone, even the viewer. She was involved with Light during his university years and later, as a TV news anchor, openly supported Kira and was one of the few other people that also knew his real identity. She was deliberately created to play well against Light and has a similar character arc, but hers is cut short as Kira's plans start to unravel.

                  <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title">Teru-Mikami</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The idea of having another Kira is something that was executed with deft finesse in Death Note. Teru Mikami is a great example to illustrate the benefits of this particular angle in the story. He might not be one of the best Death Note characters but he is one of the most interesting.</p>

                  <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title">Soichiro-Yagami</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">It's funny how the lead investigator of the Kira Investigation Team didn't even realize that the perpetrator he was looking for was none other than his own son. It was Soichiro's own optimism that would betray him, which makes his tragic arc one of the best among the Death Note main characters.</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">Misa Amane</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Initially coming off as nothing more than an obsessive fan of Kira who had absolutely no other motivations in life, it's incredible how Misa Amane managed to break past this barrier and establish herself as a brilliant character in her own right.</p>

                  <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title">Ryuk</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">Of course, it would be impossible to talk about the best characters of Death Note without mentioning the brilliance of Ryuk — a Shinigami that ended up being one of the most compelling characters of the show.</p>

                  <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title">Light</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The protagonist of the series also ends up being its most compelling Death Note character by a mile, with the transformation of the honor student Light Yagami into the serial killer with a god-complex who goes by the moniker of Kira being a highly interesting one indeed.

                      However, it's the manner in which Light manipulates everyone and everything around him that makes him all the more interesting to watch. While his web of lies is ultimately unraveled by the end, the journey is still highly compelling in every sense of the word.</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">L</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The world's greatest detective is also one of the best characters in anime history, and one need only look at L's quirky mannerisms and eccentric personality to understand why this is the case. His whole being, including his background as an orphan and his anti-social personality, is created as a foil to that of the handsome and popular Light.</p>

                  <div class="card-body">
                    <h5 class="card-title">Touta-Matsuda</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">A member of the Kira Investigation Team, Matsuda starts out as little more than comic relief as a main Death Note character. He's depicted as the clumsy, inept one of the group but he's also a decent shot and has a talent for undercover work. At one point, he actually expresses some sympathy with Kira only to be severely reprimanded for it by his mentor Soichiro.</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">Rem</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The idea of a God of Death developing feelings for a human to the point where they could be manipulated into doing their bidding is a testament to just how amazing Rem is as a Death Note character. Anything she ever says is short, honest, and often sharp to the point.</p>
