              <p class="card-text">Ken Ryuguji, commonly referred to as "Draken," instantly stole fans' hearts.

              <p class="card-text">Baji was one of the founding members of the Tokyo Manji Gang. He's remembered as a daredevil and fiercely loyal comrade.

                <p class="card-text">Despite being the protagonist, Takemichi isn't the most popular character in the series. His arc is relatively polarizing, and a common complaint is that his extreme emotions derail the entire show. That said, Takemichi's emotions are his greatest strength — without them, he wouldn't be recognized as the "Crybaby Hero."</p>
