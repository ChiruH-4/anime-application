                  <h5 class="card-title">Satoru Gojo</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">By far the most popular character in the entire franchise, the strongest sorcerer of the modern era, Satoru Gojo, rightfully earned the fanbase’s love. Considered unbeatable due to being born with two outstandingly overpowered techniques (Six Eyes and Limitless), Gojo initially comes off as cocky and obnoxiously self-assured. Yet, he swiftly proves himself worthy of his reputation in practice. Gojo’s character is an inventive reimagining of the overpowered hero archetype, as much of his development revolves around themes of contemplating what it means to be the strongest, and how it affects his perception of himself and his ability to connect to others.

                  <h5 class="card-title">Yuji Itadori</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">At first glance, little sets Yuji Itadori apart from shonen’s archetypal protagonists. He is kind-hearted, virtuous, and determined to defend his ideals, even if it means putting himself in harm’s way. Initially unfamiliar with the world of Jujutsu, Yuji swiftly adapts to being Sukuna’s vessel and becomes one of the series’ strongest, most resilient fighters despite not having an innate technique. Yet, what makes Yuji stand out from the sea of other good-natured shonen heroes is the subtlety of his character growth, developed through the hardships he had to endure as a Jujutsu sorcerer.

                  <h5 class="card-title">Sukuna </h5>
                  <p class="card-text">From the moment Yuji has eaten one of the King of Curses’ fingers in JJK episode 1, becoming the new vessel of history’s most terrifying monster, Sukuna has been acting as an ever-present threat to Yuji and the Jujutsu world at large. A demon from the past barely sealed away by the sorcerers of the Golden Age of Jujutsu, Sukuna is not the type of villain to have a tragic backstory or a justifiable goal. Instead, he is a malicious, immoral hedonist who wants to enjoy himself while plummeting the world into chaos, and that’s exactly what makes him an exceptional antagonist.

                  <h5 class="card-title">Maki Zenin</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">Born into the powerful Zenin family with no cursed energy and, as a result, no ability to use Jujutsu, Maki Zenin was shunned and disregarded from a very young age. Yet, instead of letting the prejudice of society discourage her, Maki used her anger to fuel her ambitions, working tirelessly to become a sorcerer who doesn’t need cursed energy to best everyone else. Headstrong and blunt, Maki can be admired for her determination and strength of character from the very start.

                    <p class="card-text">A rather mysterious character at the start of the series, Suguru Geto develops into an instant fan-favorite once his backstory is revealed in the Hidden Inventory arc. Satoru Gojo’s best friend and a fellow special grade, Geto used to be the more morally righteous and dignified of the two. He often guided Gojo in ethically uncertain situations. Yet, following the death of Riko Amanai, Geto began to harbor more and more resentment towards humans. Over time, the gap between him and Gojo continued to grow, and eventually, Geto’s hatred boiled over with him betraying the ideals of the Jujutsu society.

                    <h5 class="card-title">Yuta Okkotsu</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The hero of the prequel movie Jujutsu Kaisen 0 and one of the most prominent characters in the current phase of the manga, Yuta Okkotsu was initially perceived coldly by the fanbase due to his lackluster personality and questionable relevance to the main plot. Yet, even by the end of his film, Yuta had already convinced many that he might be one of the series’ best characters. A special grade sorcerer in Jujutsu Kaisen with two outstanding powers — his innate technique, Copy, and the cursed spirit of Rika, his deceased childhood friend — Yuta begins as a timid and self-conscious kid who struggles to accept his Jujutsu powers.

                    <p class="card-text">Despite his limited presence in the series, Aoi Todo stands out from other students of Kyoto Jujutsu High School due to just how memorable of a personality he is. Passionate and eccentric, Todo knows how to make an impression, blindsiding fans and the Tokyo students immediately with his intrusive questions about Megumi’s taste in women. Yet, once Todo finds his “brother” in Yuji, new sides of his personality begin to shine. These include his outstanding battle intelligence and an unexpectedly philosophical worldview, which few expect from such a brawny, battle-crazed hero.

                    <p class="card-text">Yuji’s respected mentor figure and one of the top sorcerers protecting Jujutsu High’s younger generation, Kento Nanami, is a character whose impact on the series was undeniably enormous. While Nanami comes off as aloof and downhearted, showing little obvious kindness to others and often making straightforwardly negative remarks, his heart is one of the biggest in the entire cast. Nanami takes his job incredibly seriously and is determined to protect the weak with his sorcerer skills to the bitter end.

He also has a partial Domain Expansion known as Chimera Shadow Garden. Megumi is only a high school student bet he's already made a name for himself at Jujutsu High.

Her Straw Doll Cursed Technique is particularly ruthless as she takes down Curse after Curse. However, Kugisaki isn’t all about fighting. She also has a lot of heart. Kugisaki loves playing pranks and goofing around with Yuji Itadori and Megumi Fushiguro.

Choso hasn’t been in the Jujutsu Kaisen anime long, but he’s already made a name for himself. His Blood Manipulation Cursed Technique is one of the most dynamic and devastating. However, his true claim to fame is his fight scene with Yuji Itadori in Season 2, Episode 37, "Red Scale". Choso’s incredible combat skills — even in such close quarters — speak to his prowess.
