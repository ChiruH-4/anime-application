                  <h5 class="card-title">Okarun</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">Ken Takakura, nicknamed Okarun by Momo, is Dandadan’s lovable unconventional lead, and hardly any character in the series is adored more than him. Initially introduced as an awkward and friendless introvert obsessed with all things extraterrestrial, Okarun begins to transform once the occult enters his life.
                    Okarun’s journey of coming out of his shell and working towards becoming strong enough to protect his loved ones is a touching one, and his character growth - alongside the development of his and Momo’s relationship - acts as the foundation of the entire series. Far from your typical shonen underdog or an overpowered hero, Okarun is one of new-gen’s most nuanced and riveting heroes who matches Dandadan’s unorthodox tone to a T.

                  <h5 class="card-title"> Momo Ayase</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">Dandadan’s fierce and courageous heroine, Momo Ayase is one of the best female characters in modern shonen manga. Preferring to exude a confident, righteous demeanor, Momo is, nevertheless, a tender-hearted and empathetic person who can’t tolerate injustice - especially when it concerns her friends.

                    Unyielding when it comes to both her supernatural prowess and inner resilience, Momo’s greatest weakness and most adorable quality is her inability to deal with strong emotions - something that drives much of the humorous drama in her and Okarun’s romance. Competent, amusing, and endlessly compelling in her expressiveness and strength of character, Momo fully deserves the fans’ unanimous adoration.</p>

                  <h5 class="card-title">Jiji’s Goofy</h5>
                  <p class="card-text">Momo’s childhood friend and first crush, Jiji enters the narrative of Dandadan as Okarun’s first potential rival for his love interest’s heart. Yet, any caution fans might’ve felt upon Jiji’s introduction swiftly blows over once he shows his true colors - a quirky and eccentric demeanor outlined by all-encompassing friendliness and kindness.

                    An excitable teenager who loves joking around, Jiji always sees the best in people and offers his friendship to everyone who might need it- be it the jealous and unsure Okarun or the Evil Eye, a murderous yokai Jiji recognizes for the lost child that he is and saves regardless of the dangers he poses. Strong-willed, easygoing, and overwhelmingly kind, Jiji is the sort of character one can’t help but love.</p>

                  <h5 class="card-title">Seiko Ayase </h5>
                  <p class="card-text">As far as mentor characters in shonen go, Momo’s grandmother Seiko is certainly unconventional. A dismissive, immature spirit medium with a foul mouth and a tendency to be absent in the most crucial moments, Seiko, nevertheless, is the force that holds her makeshift Family of misfits together.

                    Beneath her overly casual and unserious facade, Seiko is an individual of unparalleled generosity, willing to welcome anyone - from aliens to yokai to troublesome teenagers - into her home and treat them to a hearty meal. Possessing an immense love for her granddaughter and a well of spirit-related knowledge, Seiko carefully guides the young people she takes under her wing - all while giving them their fair share of autonomy and room to grow on their own.

                    <h5 class="card-title">Aira Shiratori</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">One of the first characters to join Momo and Okarun on their quest to challenge the occult, Aira Shiratori is a heroine of both tremendous entertainment value and heartfelt nuance. Initially introduced as a mean-spirited “popular girl” obsessed with others’ opinions, Aira undergoes a massive change of character thanks to her encounter with Acrobatic Silky and the friendship she develops with Momo and Okarun.

                        However, Aira’s transformation into a more genuine person didn’t result in her losing the comical charm of her arrogance. From her hilariously unreciprocated crush on Okarun to her delusions of grandeur as the group’s aspiring leader, Aira is a character whose faults carry narrative weight on top of being funny and endearing.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">A character who had the swiftest transition from a sideline ally to an adored fan favorite, Unji Zuma is the central hero of Dandadan’s Danmanra arc - a mysterious delinquent who gets sucked into the game-like diorama world of the Fairy-Tale Card. While initially perceived with caution, Zuma is revealed to be a kind and selfless individual who uses his delinquent notoriety to help outcasts with nowhere to turn to - not unlike he was in his younger days.</p>

Despite not having a way to effectively communicate with humans for most of her arc, Bamora establishes an earnest bond with the protagonists, becoming a dear friend and ally to the Family despite the hurdles and misunderstandings that plague her journey of being accepted.</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">Kinta Sakata</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">A rather polarizing character due to his seemingly superficial, attention-seeking personality, Kinta Sakata has, nevertheless, earned the adoration of fans by always pulling his weight when it matters most. A mecha-obsessed chunibyo who inserts himself into Okarun and Momo’s group during the Kaiju arc, Kinta is initially thought of as nothing but a liability.</p>

                    <h5 class="card-title">Turbo Granny</h5>
                    <p class="card-text">The spirit who has started it all by first putting a curse on Okarun and then promptly losing his “kintama,” Turbo Granny is the first yokai introduced in the series, and her formidable speed and creepy appearance sell the threat spirits can pose excellently. However, once the legendary yokai gets sealed inside a cutesy maneki-neko doll, she turns from a terrifying enemy to an endlessly entertaining mascot.

                        Turbo Granny’s uncooperative antics and foul-mouthed banter make up some of Dandadan’s most amusing gags. Yet, the heart of this seemingly simple character is unexpectedly profound. Spending her time as a spirit comforting the restless souls of deceased girls, Turbo Granny slowly but surely develops a kinship with the Family, reluctantly aiding Okarun, helping Seiko on her missions, and even risking her life to stay behind with Momo during the Danmanra arc.
